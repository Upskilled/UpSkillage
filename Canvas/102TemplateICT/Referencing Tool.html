        <p class="" style="padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">At Upskilled we advocate very strongly that students are referencing correctly for their written assessment submissions (in this case Harvard Formatting).</p>
        <p class="" style="padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">Referencing is important for several reasons. It is good practice when you are submitting assessments, not only to show that you can use your own words and understanding to address the required areas of the assessment but also that you show you have accessed relevant accurate information from a reputable source to back up your answers. Applying this approach is professional and shows you can apply this process as an academic. This is particularly relevant not only when you plan on possibly completing further study at a university or the like but generally in your approach to all professional writing that you produce in the future. Plagiarism is where you have literally copied and pasted other peoples work and have claimed it as your own. Be mindful that our Trainers and Assessors are well versed in identifying when this occurs.</p>
        <p class="" style="padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">Consider: Next time you are addressing assessment questions, really think about what the question is asking of you before you answer it, do some research on those specific areas, try to use a reputable source such as a government website or an academic journal article if you can. This is not entirely necessary for all your work, of course, you can access information from other sources such as the learning resources provided by Upskilled. Generally, it is important to consider how relevant and reputable the source of your information is (empirical, peer-reviewed etc.). To reference as required academically, you should be providing &lsquo;in text&rsquo; referencing and a Bibliography at the end of your written assessment submissions.</p>
        <p class="" style="padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">External Resources: There are relevant industry resource links throughout your learning material. It can also be helpful to look into the &lsquo;Other Resources&rsquo; sections of your course which have relevant, reputable resources you can use for your assessments and reference.</p>
        <p class="" style="padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">Referencing is a valuable skill: It is a professional trait for you to have the capacity to reference and to be proficient and competent at addressing academic submissions by the time you complete your course. Upskilled, as a Training Provider would not be doing you justice if we did not ask you to reference your work. Upskilled has put a lot of effort to ensure that we resource students with the required tools to facilitate the referencing requirements at this level. This skill will stay with you for life.</p>
        <p class="" style="padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">To be clear Upskilled does not expect you to provide referencing on every single area within a written assessment. Consider when you go through your assessment questions if the question is addressing a specific area, consider whether it would be good to back up your answer with a relevant source, perhaps including a quote from the source and the corresponding Harvard in-text referencing with it.</p>
        <p class="" style="padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">The links below will assist you in providing the correct format for your Bibliography. Just choose Harvard style, put in the website link and it will create the resource formatting for you.</p>
