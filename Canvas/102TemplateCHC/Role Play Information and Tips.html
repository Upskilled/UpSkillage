            <h3 class="loree-iframe-content-element text-transform-none" style="margin: 10px 0 0 0; padding: 10px 10px 0 10px; font-size: 21px; color: #1548e0;">Why role plays?</h3>
            <p class="loree-iframe-content-element" style="margin: 0; padding: 10px;">Role playing is a tool used by trainers and assessors to assess students and their capacity to demonstrate knowledge and skills by playing a particular role that relates to the area they are studying. i.e. a Case Manager in the Community Services industry. In this respect it is important that students have given themselves enough time to be well prepared for each role play and what is expected of them in this role to be facilitated in an assessment environment.</p>
            <h3 class="loree-iframe-content-element text-transform-none" style="margin: 10px 0 0 0; padding: 10px 10px 0 10px; font-size: 21px; color: #1548e0;">Preparation</h3>
            <p class="loree-iframe-content-element" style="margin: 0; padding: 10px;">It is recommended that students will have completed all necessary preparation including research of the required areas they are facilitating before conducting their role play assessment/s. Students need to ensure that they fully understand what is required of them to address all areas as described within the role play assessment/s.</p>
            <p class="loree-iframe-content-element" style="margin: 0; padding: 10px;">Preparation could include:</p>
            <ul class="" style="margin: 0; padding: 5px;">
                <li class="" style="padding: 10px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px;" data-highlightable="1">studying the assessment requirements and related documents in detail,</li>
                <li class="" style="padding: 10px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px;" data-highlightable="1">practicing the role play in the student&rsquo;s course with other students, with work colleagues, friends or family members,</li>
                <li class="" style="padding: 10px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px;" data-highlightable="1">consulting with their trainer and assessor so that they are familiar with how they will go about facilitating that role and its requirements competently.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="loree-iframe-content-element text-transform-none" style="margin: 10px 0 0 0; padding: 10px 10px 0 10px; font-size: 21px; color: #1548e0;">Preparing role play participants</h3>
            <p class="loree-iframe-content-element" style="margin: 0; padding: 10px;">It is necessary for students to be clear about who will be playing the other part/s within the role play/s (clients etc.) and how they will prepare them for this. This is extremely important as the role play participants will need to be well informed and play their part competently for the student to facilitate their role and address the required areas of the assessment.</p>
            <p class="loree-iframe-content-element" style="margin: 0; padding: 10px;">Ensuring role play participants are well prepared could include:</p>
            <ul class="" style="margin: 0; padding: 5px;">
                <li class="" style="padding: 10px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px;" data-highlightable="1">providing them with all information necessary on the role play part and discussing this with them (such as a Case Scenario) so that they are aware of the specifics of their role within the role play.</li>
                <li class="" style="padding: 10px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px;" data-highlightable="1">The student could also practice the role play with the role play participants before the role play takes place and</li>
                <li class="" style="padding: 10px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px;" data-highlightable="1">be available for any questions the role play participant may have.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="loree-iframe-content-element text-transform-none" style="margin: 10px 0 0 0; padding: 10px 10px 0 10px; font-size: 21px; color: #1548e0;">Role play facilitation</h3>
            <p class="loree-iframe-content-element" style="margin: 0; padding: 10px;">Students should be confident in their ability if they are well prepared and have prepared the role play participants as required. Assessors are looking to see that students can competently cover the areas in the assessment instructions within the allotted time frame. At the time of facilitating the actual role play/ students need to ensure their role play is competent, focused and clear, addressing all required areas within that time frame.</p>
            <h3 class="loree-iframe-content-element text-transform-none" style="margin: 10px 0 0 0; padding: 10px 10px 0 10px; font-size: 21px; color: #1548e0;">Role playing and interactive learning activities</h3>

Not only are they fun and interactive, it gives you the opportunity to collaborate with other participants such as other students, your family, friends and or colleagues.</p>
            <p class="loree-iframe-content-element" style="margin: 0; padding: 10px;">Below are some benefits you can experience when role-playing:</p>
            <h4 class="loree-iframe-content-element text-transform-none" style="margin: 10px 0 0 0; padding: 10px 10px 0 10px; font-size: 18px; color: #000000;">Improved decision making and communication skills</h4>
            <p class="loree-iframe-content-element" style="margin: 0; padding: 10px;">Working in health and community services may involve you working in a variety of work settings. Professionals in this field are expected to make decisions and communicate effectively with clients, colleagues and stakeholders. Our role-playing assessments can help further improve your decision-making and communication skills in a community service workplace.</p>
            <h4 class="loree-iframe-content-element text-transform-none" style="margin: 10px 0 0 0; padding: 10px 10px 0 10px; font-size: 18px; color: #000000;">Preparation for work placement</h3>
            <p class="loree-iframe-content-element" style="margin: 0; padding: 10px;">Role-playing is effective in helping you prepare for work placement. Before you go on work placement, you'll need to complete most of the theory components of your course. The skills and knowledge developed from your role-playing assessments are based on scenarios you may face when working in the community services industry.</p>
            <h4 class="loree-iframe-content-element text-transform-none" style="margin: 10px 0 0 0; padding: 10px 10px 0 10px; font-size: 18px; color: #000000;">Develop knowledge and skills to be "work-ready"</h3>
            <p class="loree-iframe-content-element" style="margin: 0; padding: 10px;">Due to the interactive nature of role-playing, it can be an opportunity to practice community service industry roles with volunteers and other students to enhance your knowledge and skills. Job roles within this field are "hands-on", so role-playing can prepare you for the physical nature of the work - particularly in the disability and aged care sectors.</p>
