        <h3 class="" style="margin: 20px 0 10px 0; padding: 10px; font-size: 32px; color: #1548e0;">Identify and analyse potential emotional stressors in the workplace</h3>
        <p class="" style="margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px;">It is important to identify emotional stressors in the workplace. These are what trigger your stress and other negative emotions such as anger and sadness. If stress is becoming a problem for you and your team members, you may need to take action to reduce this. Too much stress reduces emotional intelligence, which negatively impacts your leadership capabilities.</p>
        <p class="" style="margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px;">A certain amount of stress is normal, but the main culprits of severe work-related stress are the following:</p>
        <ul class="" style="margin: 0; padding: 5px;">
            <li class="" style="padding: 5px 0 5px 10px; margin: 0 0 0 30px;" data-highlightable="1">Deadlines</li>
            <li class="" style="padding: 5px 0 5px 10px; margin: 0 0 0 30px;" data-highlightable="1">Interpersonal conflicts</li>
            <li class="" style="padding: 5px 0 5px 10px; margin: 0 0 0 30px;" data-highlightable="1">Staff management</li>
            <li class="" style="padding: 5px 0 5px 10px; margin: 0 0 0 30px;" data-highlightable="1">Dealing with too many issues and problems</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="" style="margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px;">Not everything in the workplace can be controlled, but that does not mean there is nothing you can do. It is about finding ways to manage workplace stress, not about making huge changes, or rethinking your ambitions. The only thing you can have constant control over is yourself, so focus on that.</p>
        <p class="" style="margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px;">Some symptoms, both physical and psychological, of chronic stress are:</p>
        <ul class="" style="margin: 0; padding: 5px;">
            <li class="" style="padding: 5px 0 5px 10px; margin: 0 0 0 30px;" data-highlightable="1">Depression</li>
            <li class="" style="padding: 5px 0 5px 10px; margin: 0 0 0 30px;" data-highlightable="1">Anxiety</li>
            <li class="" style="padding: 5px 0 5px 10px; margin: 0 0 0 30px;" data-highlightable="1">Irritability</li>
            <li class="" style="padding: 5px 0 5px 10px; margin: 0 0 0 30px;" data-highlightable="1">Feeling unmotivated</li>
            <li class="" style="padding: 5px 0 5px 10px; margin: 0 0 0 30px;" data-highlightable="1">Compulsive behaviour</li>
            <li class="" style="padding: 5px 0 5px 10px; margin: 0 0 0 30px;" data-highlightable="1">Sleeping disorders</li>
            <li class="" style="padding: 5px 0 5px 10px; margin: 0 0 0 30px;" data-highlightable="1">Weight changes</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="" style="margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px;">Even if a job has become increasingly stressful, you can retain a large measure of self-control and self-confidence by understanding and practising emotional intelligence. When it comes to work satisfaction and success, it matters just as much as intellectual ability. Emotional intelligence is about communicating with others effectively, overcoming differences and defusing tension and stress.</p>
        <h4 class="" style="margin: 20px 0 10px 0; padding: 10px; font-size: 26px;">Identifying emotions</h4>
        <p class="" style="margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px;">The first step to identifying emotional stressors is to be aware of what emotions you feel. However, feelings are complex, and it is difficult to identify them. You may have been taught to ignore and override your feelings as most people have. Sometimes, even if you can identify them, it may become hard to express them appropriately. For example, feeling mild annoyance may be expressed as intense anger. It is important to identify your feelings to be able to express them properly.</p>
        <p class="" style="margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px;">Before you learn to identify them, it is important to understand the following about your feelings:</p>
        <div class="" style="padding: 10px;"><iframe id="Accordion_2838" title="BSBPEF502 1.3 ACCORDION" src="https://loree-int.crystaldelta.net/Accordion/2838" width="100%" height="400"></iframe></div>
        <p class="" style="margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px;">As discussed, suppressed emotions manifest themselves through bodily sensations. It is important to tune into your body to identify what you feel. A process called 'experiential focusing' was developed by Eugene Gendlin (2007). This process allows you to give a concrete form to your emotions, which makes it easier to identify them. The following are the steps for tuning into your body:</p>
        <p class="" style="margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px;"><img class="" style="width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 600px;" title="" src="https://upskilled.instructure.com/courses/659/files/154722/download" alt="Experiential focusing" data-api-endpoint="https://upskilled.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/659/files/154722" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
        <h4 class="" style="margin: 20px 0 10px 0; padding: 10px; font-size: 26px;">Identifying emotional stressors</h4>
        <p class="" style="margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px;">Controlling your emotions means you can recognise them and can develop strategies to act on them when appropriate. The following steps may help you with the process of identifying and analysing emotional stressors in the workplace:</p>
        <div class="" style="padding: 10px;"><iframe id="Accordion_2840" title="BSBPEF502 1.3 ACCORDION 2" src="https://loree-int.crystaldelta.net/Accordion/2840" width="100%" height="400"></iframe></div>
        <p class="" style="margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px;">You may already know what triggers certain emotions in you but analysing it further by using the steps outlined above may help you discover the hidden roots of your stress. For example, an employee may have made a joke while talking to their manager, but the manager did not laugh. The employee interpreted the lack of reaction as the manager being angry at them and jumped to the conclusion that they did not do a good job that day. This can spiral to feelings of sadness and inadequacy, all in just a short amount of time without the person even being aware of it. If they took the time to analyse their feelings in that situation, they would have realised that the manager's lack of reaction was not an expression of anger toward them.</p>
        <p class="" style="margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px;">There is nothing wrong with negative feelings and thoughts, as you cannot control them all the time. These are natural, but you should not let them consume you with worry. Like the example above, there may have been times that you assumed something was about you. You may have misinterpreted something and felt anger or sadness. Feeling those emotions now is fine, just take the time later to calm down and analyse your emotional state.</p>
        <p class="" style="margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px;">You should also note what kind of relationship you have with your emotions.</p>
        <ul class="" style="margin: 0; padding: 5px;">
            <li class="" style="padding: 5px 0 5px 10px; margin: 0 0 0 30px;" data-highlightable="1">Do you experience feelings that change smoothly, encountering one emotion after another as your experiences change?</li>
            <li class="" style="padding: 5px 0 5px 10px; margin: 0 0 0 30px;" data-highlightable="1">Are your emotions accompanied by physical sensations, in places such as your stomach or chest?</li>
            <li class="" style="padding: 5px 0 5px 10px; margin: 0 0 0 30px;" data-highlightable="1">Do you experience discrete feelings, such as anger, sadness, fear, and joy, each of which is evident even in subtle facial expressions?</li>
            <li class="" style="padding: 5px 0 5px 10px; margin: 0 0 0 30px;" data-highlightable="1">Can you experience feelings strong enough to capture others' attention?</li>
            <li class="" style="padding: 5px 0 5px 10px; margin: 0 0 0 30px;" data-highlightable="1">Do you factor your emotions into your decision-making?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="" style="margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px;">If any of these experiences are unfamiliar, then you may have learned to suppress or disregard the emotions you are feeling. Many people are disconnected from their emotions, especially the strong core emotions such as anger, fear, sadness, and joy. This may be the result of experiences that taught them to shut their feelings off. But although emotions can be distorted, denied, or ignored, they cannot be eliminated. They are still there, whether the person is aware of them or not.</p>
        <p class="" style="margin: 10px 0; padding: 10px;">To be emotionally healthy and intelligent, you must rediscover and reconnect with your emotions, accept them, and become comfortable with them. Do not let your past emotions and the situations that triggered them distract you from your goal. Learn to recognise and anticipate what triggers your emotions.</p>
